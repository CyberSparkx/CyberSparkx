# 👋 Hi, I'm Naren Roy  
### 🎨 Animating the Web with Cutting-Edge 2D & 3D Experiences

I’m a passionate Web Developer focused on **visually immersive** and **interactive** websites using modern tools like **React**, **GSAP**, **React Three Fiber**, and **Shery.js**.  
I love turning creative ideas into smooth animations and 3D experiences — from subtle micro-interactions to full-blown 3D worlds.
